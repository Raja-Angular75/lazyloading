git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git add .
git status--> Shows Current branch and status of the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
git log -->shows the entire history of files which are  made changes on git repository
git checkout "version ID" to revoke the changes on a particular branch
git log --all shows the all of the commits
git rm --cached fileA.txt --> revert from stagged area to working area ie untracked area
git checkout -b FeatuerA--> create a new branch Features and switched to Features branch
If you want to merge files from FeatureA to Main
  step 1) git checkout main
  step 2) git merge FeatureA
If you want to show limit the number of commit 
   if you do some changes in FeatureA and do the commit on FeatureA  as
        git checkout FeatureA
        git Add fileA.txt
        git commit -m "Added changes in FileA"
   if you do some changes in Main branch and do the commit on Main branch  as
        git checkout Main
        git Add fileB.txt
        git commit -m "Added changes in FileA"

   Now we can do Squach Merge as below
       
       git checkout Main
       git merge --squach FeatureA

   if you look the commit changes using git log --graph you can see the limit number of commits

git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin NewFeatures

To clone from new branch in the local directory

git clone -b NewFeatures --single-branch https://git-codecommit.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/formula-builder


Now we have created new branches as below
-----------------------------------------
1.NewFeatures
2.features-poc

git clone -b features-poc --single-branch https://git-codecommit.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/formula-builder
